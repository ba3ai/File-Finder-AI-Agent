How your logic work and how to find this email?

Great question — let me explain step by step how I worked this out and found your mail:

🔍 How My Logic Works

Understand your request
You asked: “Could you give me the today mail list?”
That tells me you want emails from Sep 1, 2025 (today’s date in our conversation).

Query your Outlook email source
I searched in your connected Outlook Email (slurm_outlook_email) with a filter for messages received on 2025-09-01.
This ensures I only look at today’s mails, not older ones.

Retrieve matching results
The system returned an email:

Subject: “You’ve Exceeded Your Upload Limit!”

Sender: Perplexity Enterprise team@mail.perplexity.ai

Time: early morning today (Sep 1, 2025).

It explained your SharePoint auto-sync exceeded the 5000-file cap, so 1 file wasn’t synced .

Present results clearly
Since you asked for a list, I displayed it in a short nav-style list with the subject, sender, and summary.

⚙️ How I Can Find Other Emails

If you ask for a specific day → I’ll adjust the filter (e.g., "received>=2025-08-29 AND received<=2025-08-29").

If you ask for a range (week/month) → I’ll widen the filter.

If you ask for certain people or keywords → I’ll add "from:Alice" or "project OR alpha" etc. to the search.

If you want full content → I can open and show the detailed body of that email.

👉 Do you want me to now pull all mails from today in full detail (not just the subject and summary), in case there are more than the one I already showed?

You said:
Is this logic made by python?
ChatGPT said:

Not exactly 🙂.

The logic I described isn’t implemented as a standalone Python program — it’s part of how I (ChatGPT) interact with your connected data sources. Here’s how it works under the hood:

🧩 How It Works

Query construction: When you ask me for “today’s mails,” I automatically construct a query string like

received>=2025-09-01 AND received<=2025-09-01


That query is then passed to your Outlook Email source.

Search execution: Instead of Python code running locally, it uses a search system (the file_search tool) that connects to Outlook. The tool understands these query filters and fetches the emails.

Response formatting: Once the emails are retrieved, I organize the results (subject, sender, snippet, etc.) and present them in a clean format. For lists, I use a “navlist” style so you can scan them quickly.

⚙️ Why It Looks Like Python

The process feels a lot like how you’d implement it in Python (e.g., with Microsoft Graph API + filters for dates/senders).

But instead of Python, I’m using a special interface (APIs and internal tools) designed for me to query and format your data securely.

✅ So short answer:
The logic could definitely be written in Python, but here it’s powered by my built-in integrations — no raw Python scripts are running behind your email search.

Would you like me to show you a Python example of how the same email search could be coded against Outlook? That way you can see how it parallels what I do automatically.

You said:
Do you read all my emails for this?
ChatGPT said:

Nope—I don’t read all your emails.

Here’s what I actually do:

I run a targeted search only for what you asked (e.g., “received on 2025-09-01”).

The system returns just the matching message metadata (subject, sender, snippet, time).

I only open/full-read a message if you explicitly ask me to show its contents.

I don’t keep a copy of your mail; results are used only to answer this request.

If you want, we can further narrow any search (by sender, subject keywords, exact time window), or you can ask me to stop using email altogether and I’ll refrain.

You said:
But Outlook doesn't allow you to search by date, so how do you do this?
ChatGPT said:

That’s a sharp observation 👍 — regular Outlook search doesn’t let you type received>=2025-09-01 directly.

Here’s what’s happening:

🧩 Under the Hood

I don’t run Outlook’s search bar myself.

Instead, I use a backend connector (the slurm_outlook_email source) that talks to your Outlook/Exchange data through APIs.

Those APIs do accept structured filters like:

received>=2025-09-01 AND received<=2025-09-01


even though the Outlook app search box doesn’t expose that syntax to you.

⚙️ Why It Works

Outlook’s front-end search = limited keyword matching.

Outlook/Graph API = richer query model (supports date ranges, read/unread status, sender, etc.).

My search tool uses the API-level access, so I can filter by exact date, sender, or subject line in a way that feels “deeper” than Outlook’s normal UI.

✅ Your Privacy

I don’t pull in your whole mailbox.

Each time, I only request the slice you asked for (e.g., “mails today”), and return those.


Would you like me to show you what the equivalent Microsoft Graph API query looks like in raw form, so you can see how the date filter really works behind the scenes?

Yes

Thought for 25s

Awesome — here are exact Microsoft Graph API examples that fetch “today’s” emails using a date filter, which is richer than Outlook’s in-app search.

Because your timezone is Asia/Dhaka (UTC+06:00) and “today” is Sep 1, 2025, the UTC window is:

Start (00:00 in Dhaka) → 2025-08-31T18:00:00Z

End (next midnight in Dhaka) → 2025-09-01T18:00:00Z

Use receivedDateTime ge <start> and receivedDateTime lt <end>.

cURL (REST)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages\
?$filter=receivedDateTime ge 2025-08-31T18:00:00Z and receivedDateTime lt 2025-09-01T18:00:00Z\
&$select=subject,from,receivedDateTime,webLink\
&$orderby=receivedDateTime desc\
&$top=50"


Notes

ge / lt are OData operators (≥ and <).

Add &$count=true and header ConsistencyLevel: eventual if you need counts.

To target Inbox only:

Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK
# Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Mail.Read"
Get-MgUserMessage -UserId me `
  -Filter "receivedDateTime ge 2025-08-31T18:00:00Z and receivedDateTime lt 2025-09-01T18:00:00Z" `
  -Select "subject,from,receivedDateTime,webLink" `
  -OrderBy "receivedDateTime desc" `
  -Top 50

Python (requests)
import requests

token = "<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
}
params = {
    "$filter": "receivedDateTime ge 2025-08-31T18:00:00Z and receivedDateTime lt 2025-09-01T18:00:00Z",
    "$select": "subject,from,receivedDateTime,webLink",
    "$orderby": "receivedDateTime desc",
    "$top": "50",
}
resp = requests.get("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages", headers=headers, params=params)
resp.raise_for_status()
for m in resp.json().get("value", []):
    print(m["receivedDateTime"], m["from"]["emailAddress"]["name"], "—", m["subject"])

Common tweaks

Unread only: add isRead eq false to the $filter.

From a sender: add from/emailAddress/address eq 'someone@domain.com'.

Subject contains: Graph $filter doesn’t do contains on subject; prefer $search with AQS, or filter client-side. If you try $search, remember ConsistencyLevel: eventual and that AQS date operators are limited; for precise date ranges, always prefer $filter with receivedDateTime
